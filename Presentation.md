## Educators' views

[LuleÃ¥ University of Technology staff survey](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.03486)
* 76.12% of the university teachers surveyed expressed willingness to encourage their students to use generative AI ethically.
* Over 50% currently use generative AI in some form.

[Texas A&M University](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.14415)
* 47% are somewhat to extremely comfortable with students using ChatGPT in courses.
* 64% of faculty and 73% of students have used ChatGPT.

### Challenges: Enhancing student learning experience

* Balancing technology with human guidance
* Ethical and pedagogical concerns
* Technocratic solutions versus human problems

## Students' views

[HEPI Policy Note 51](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HEPI-Policy-Note-51.pdf)

* **More than half of students (53%) have used generative AI to help them with assessments.** 
The most common use is as an â€˜AI private tutorâ€™ (36%), helping to explain concepts.

* **A â€˜digital divideâ€™ in AI use may be emerging.** Nearly three-fifths of students from the most privileged backgrounds (58%) use generative AI for assessments, compared with just half (51%) from the least privileged backgrounds. 

* **Only a fifth of students (22%) are satisfied with the support they have received on AI.** Most students (62%) are neutral or say they do not know.

## Student responses

* **P2:** "I learn better through struggling to find an answer. If it comes too easy, itâ€™s hard for me to remember any information Iâ€™ve learned."

* **P11:** "I have a vitriolic hatred toward AI."

<!-- _footer: "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3576882.3617921" -->

## Purpose of study

* To inform generative AI-based pedagogical developments
    - University policy
    - Staff guidance and training
    - Integration into teaching and learning

---

## Survey questions: perceptions and awareness

* Do you **trust** answers from GenAI?
* Are you **encouraged** to use GenAI?
* Has using GenAI made you more **confident** in learning?
* How **anxious** do you feel when:
    * asking lecturers or colleagues for help?
    * using GenAI (for assignments)

---

## Survey questions: feeding forward


* Do you need **training** in using GenAI:
    * from lecturers or support centres?
    * to avoid plagiarism?
    * craft good prompts?
* Would you **use** GenAI for:
    * analysing data?
    * as a tutor?
